    "# Introduction to the Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "In these notebooks, students will receive an introduction to natural language processing, or NLP, and the Python library spaCy. SpaCy allows users to perform NLP tasks via Python. In academia, the Natural Language Toolkit, or NLTK, has remained quite popular. SpaCy is an industry alternative to NLTK.\n",
    "\n",
    "I enjoy using spaCy in all my NLP workflows for a few reasons. First, spaCy's syntax, or the way in which you write code to do things with the spaCy library, is fairly straightforward. Second, it allows you to construct robust pipelines for processing texts and extracting relevant information from them. Third, spaCy has powerful built-in components that allow you to use both heuristics, or rules, and machine learning. Fourth, out-of-the-box, spaCy offers pipelines and machine learning components for many modern languages. Each month their team and the community add more support for existing languages and support new languages. Fifth, training new machine learning models via spaCy is relatively simple and easy to replicate. Sixth, spaCy has a strong community and forum; if you have a question, someone is usually their to help. Seventh, spaCy scales well, meaning you can process many texts efficiently. Eighth, it is comprehensive enough to add new languages into its framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "In these three notebooks, students will learn the basics of spaCy and how to use it to solve a real-world problem in a digital humanities setting, namely information extraction via rules-based named entity recognition. Because these notebooks are designed as a primer for students new to NLP and spaCy, there are many subjects left out of these notebooks, mainly machine learning and how to train custom machine learning spaCy models.\n"

By this I mean approaching the things that spaCy does and can do and then exploring how to implement that in code. I think this is necessary so that as you explore the smaller components of spaCy, such as the Lemmatizer, you will understand how it fits into the larger architecture of the spaCy framework."

    "\n",
    "A good way to begin is by exploring the question, \"What is spaCy?\" spaCy (yes, spelled with a lowercase \"s\" and uppercase \"C\" is a natural language processing framework. **Natural language processing**, or NLP, is a branch of linguistics that seeks to parse human language in a computer system. This field is generally referred to as computational linguistics, though it has far reaching applications beyond academic linguistic research.\n",
    "\n",
    "NLP is used in every sector of industry, from academics who leverage it to aid in research to financial analysts who try and predict the stock market. Lawyers use NLP to help analyze thousands of legal documents in seconds to target their research and medical doctors use it to parse patient charts. NLP has been around for decades, but with the increased promise of deep learning, a subfield of machine learning, that NLP rapidly expanded. This is because, as we shall learn all too well throughout this book, language is inherently ambiguous. By this, I mean that language does not always make perfect sense. In some cases, it is entirely illogical. The double-negative in English is a good example of this. In some contexts, it can be an emphatic positive, as in, \"I cannot stress this enough, I do not like pasta.\" This is, of course a lie. I love pasta, but you get my point. In other cases, the double negative can be an emphatic negative, as in, \"I ain't not doing that!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "As humans, especially native speakers of a language, we can parse these complex illogical statements with ease, especially with enough context. For computers, this is not always easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because NLP is such a complex problem for computers, it requires a complex solution. The answer has been found in artificial neural networks, or ANNs or neural nets for short. These are the primary areas of research for deep learning practitioners. As the field of deep learning (and machine learning in general) expand and advance, so too does NLP. New methods for training, such as transformer models, push the field further."

Input your device settings, e.g. Mac or Windows or Linux, and your language, e.g. English, French, or German. The web-app will automatically populate the commands that you need to execute to get started. Since this is a JupyterBook, we can install these with a \"!\" before in a cell to indicate that we want to run a terminal command. I will be installing spaCy and thee small English model, en_core_web_sm."

    "    - Chinese\n",

    "Next, you can select \"Loading style\", this is how you intend to load a model in a Python script. A packaged spaCy pipeline functions like a Python library, or module. This means you can load it like any other Python package. While useful for some applications, most documentation you will see will use `spaCy.load()`, where we import spaCy into our script and load a pipeline with `load()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This page then asks you to select for either efficiency or accuracy. Efficiency refers to computational efficiency, meaning a smaller pipeline that can run faster. Accuracy refers to a model that is substantially larger, slower, and far more accurate. By default, the efficiency pipeline is the small pipeline and the accuracy pipeline is the transformer pipeline (discussed below).\n",

    "## Naming Conventions for spaCy Pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "Official spaCy pipelines have standard naming conventions. They look like this: `en_core_web_sm` or `en_core_web_trf`. Let's break down what this means.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `en`: Language. This indicates the language of the model. These are the standard 2-character representation for languages.\n",
    "- `core`: Type. this indicates the type of model or its capabilities. Core indicates that this is a general pipeline that can recognize all required spaCy components, such as tagger, parser, lemmatizer, and named entity recognition.\n",
    "- `web`: Genre. This indicates the type of data that wasa used for training. You will typically see `web` and `news` for most languages.\n",
    "- `sm`: Size. There are four sizes for spaCy pipelines: small (sm), medium (md), large (lg), and transformer (trf).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each model from spaCy is also versioned, meaning it is meant to work alongside a specific version of spaCy. As spaCy updates its core library, it also retrains its models. You will receive error messages if you use older versions of the models indicating that they not be fully supported. This does not mean that you have to update every time spaCy puts out a new version (about once every other month). Most updates are minor and do not effect the core languages significantly. However, you should know about this as some updates do create changes that can break workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key version issue to be aware of is the change from spaCy 2x (version 2) to 3x (version 3). This was a substantial overhaul, especially in how models were trained. We will learn about this in Week 3 of this course. The key thing to be aware of now is that the documentation that you are using is for spaCy 3x and the model you are using is for 3x. If you ever want to make sure of a model's current version, you can use pip."

    "## What's a Pipeline?\n",
    "\n",
    "You may hear the words spaCy model or spaCy pipeline used quite often. Let's jump into what these words mean. A model refers to a machine learning model, or a statistical model that is trained to do a specific task. A pipeline is a sequence of models, rules, or listeners that are leverage things done to date by prior components in a pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "On spaCy's main page, they use the following image to represent a standard non-transformer pipeline (small, medium, and large pipelines).\n",
    "\n",
    "![spaCy pipeline](https://spacy.io/images/pipeline-design.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a string (a text) going through this pipeline beginning at the left. As it moves down stream through each component to the right, the text is mutated. Each component in this image has a specific role and changes the text in different ways. Throughout the next few we eks, we will learn a lot more about these components and how to build some of our own, but for now, let's just stick with the basics.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the text goes into the model, it is first converted into a vector representation of a document. We will learn a lot more about word vectors and document vectors in week 3 when we dive into machine learning. For now, think of a vector representation of a text as something that allows for the spaCy pipeline to numerically understand the meaning of a text. These are complex multi-dimensional numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later components are able to use these vectors, meaning they can be trained to perform individual tasks. These are the listener components that are trained to recognize things like parts-of-speech and lemmas of words so that when a text that was not used in the training data is given to the spaCy pipeline it can make accurate (hopefully!) predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to keep this image in your mind as we work through spaCy because it is important to understand that sequence is absolutely essential. If you are designing a custom spaCy component that needs to use the lemmas of a word to do a specific task, then you need to make sure that component sits after the lemmatizer.\n"

    "In this part of the notebook, we will start working with spaCy directly. The goals of this chapter are twofold. First, it is my hope that you understand the basic spaCy syntax for creating a Doc container and how to call specific attributes of that container. Second, it is my hope that you leave this chapter with a basic understanding of the vast linguistic annotations available in spaCy. While we will not explore all attributes, we will deal with many of the most important ones, such as lemmas, parts-of-speech, and named entities. By the time you are finished with this chapter, you should have enough of a basic understanding of spaCy to begin applying it to your own texts."

    "The first thing new spaCy students need to understand is the hierarchy of spaCy data objects. In spaCy, this means beginning to interact with and understand containers. **`Containers are spaCy objects that contain a large quantity of data about a text.`** When we analyze texts with the spaCy framework, we create different container objects to do that. Here is a full list of all spaCy containers. We will be focusing on three (emboldened): Doc, Span, and Token.\n",

    "* <b>Span</b>\n",
    "* SpanGroup\n",
    "* <b>Token</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "I created the image below to show how I visualize spaCy containers in my mind. At the top, we have a Doc container. This is the basis for all spaCy. It is the main object that we create. Within the Doc container are many different attributes and subcontainers. One attribute is the Doc.sents, which contains all the sentences in the Doc container. The doc container (and each sentence generator) is made up of a set of token containers. These are things like words, punctuation, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Span containers are kind of like token, in that they are a piece of a Doc container. Spans have one thing that makes them unique. They can cross multiple tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can give spans a bit more specificity by classifying them into different groups. These are known as SpanGroup containers.\n",

You should notice that the open and close parentheses are also considered an item in the container. These are all known as tokens. **Tokens** are a fundamental building block of spaCy or any NLP framework. They can be words or punctuation marks. Tokens are something that has syntactic purpose in a sentence and is self-contained. A good example of this is the contraction \"don't\" in English. When tokenized, or the process of converting the text into tokens, we will have two tokens. \"do\" and \"n't\" because the contraction represents two words, \"do\" and \"not\".\n",

    "Another essential task of NLP, is named entity recognition, or NER. I spoke about NER in the last notebook. Here, I’d like to demonstrate how to perform basic NER via spaCy. Again, we will iterate over the doc object as we did above, but instead of iterating over doc.sents, we will iterate over doc.ents. For our purposes right now, I simply want to print off each entity’s text (the string itself) and its corresponding label (note the _ after label). I will be explaining this process in much greater detail in the next two notebooks."
